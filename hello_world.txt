This is going to be an AWESOME RIDE. 
DO NOT GIVE UP!!!!!!!!!!


Remember:
consistency > cramming, grit, persistence, YET

4 Stages:
1. Hand-holding Honeymoon
2. Cliff of Confusion
3. Desert of Despair
4. Upswing of AWESOME

Don't compare self to others. COMPARE ONLY TO SELF YESTERDAY, FEW DAYS AGO. FEW MONTHS AGO, or ONE YEAR AGO
